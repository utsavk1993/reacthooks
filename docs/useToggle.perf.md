## 📊 Observations
- ✅ The `toggle` function executes efficiently in isolation.
- ⚙️ Adding multiple hooks introduces marginal overhead, as expected in React.
- 📈 Combining multiple operations like toggling and re-rendering increases the execution time, particularly when multiple hooks are involved.
- 👍 All measured scenarios perform within acceptable limits for common usage patterns.

## 🛠 Methodology
- The performance tests were conducted using a controlled environment and simulated usage scenarios.
- 🕒 The time measurements were captured using JavaScript's `performance.now()` API.

## 💡 Recommendations
- 🔍 Ensure that `useToggle` is not overused in components with frequent re-renders to maintain optimal performance.
- 🧠 When dealing with multiple hooks, consider memoizing or batching state updates where possible.
